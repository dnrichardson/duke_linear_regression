This directory houses the R markdown file that I used to complete the Week 4 final project of the 
Linear Regression course that makes up part of the Statistics with R specialization taught by Duke Univerisity.

For this course project, we needed to put together a multivariate linear model that could be used to predict
the popularity of a movie based on several variables drawn from a dataset put together from [Rotten Tomatoes](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/) and
[IMDB](http://www.imdb.com/) ratings of a random sample of movies.
